            shock of the pandemic, the then-leaping crowds now 
            seem to have lost their vigour. Due to ageing facilities and 
            poor transportation, Zhongshan Park, and the West Park, which was a great place more 
            than 20 years ago, has now completely fallen into disrepair. 
            Grass grows in the cracks of the floor, and the buildings that
             used to hold the memories of many generations are gradually 
             deteriorating, as if there is a microcosm of the decline of an 
             era. </h4>

                <h5>The Centurl Park, named <b>Zhongshan Park</b> was originally the private garden built in the early 20th century
                    for Liu Xinsheng, the landlord of Hankou. Around <b>1914</b>, 
                    in order to enlist Li Huatang, director of finance of the
                    Hubei military government, Liu gifted this garden to Li, who named 
                    it <b>"West Garden"</b>. The garden was only 1680 square metres.
                    In <b>1927</b>, the Hankou Government confiscated the garden as enemy property.
                    Near the <b>West Garden</b>, there is a large piece of 
                    open space belonging to the Wu Peifu Fellowship, which was later </p>

                <h5>In the early summer of <b>1928</b>, Wu Guoshang, an architectural expert, 
                returned from his studies in England and took charge of the 
                construction of Zhongshan Park. Immediately, the place was 
                surrounded by a wall, soldiers and prisoners were used to dig 
                lakes and pile up mountains. The park area reached 12.5 hectares. 
                The park had an artificial lake connected by bridges from several 
                small islands. There was also a sports ground, a swimming pool,
                an ice rink, a public education centre and a memorial to the 
                Prime Minister.</h5>

                October of the same year (the anniversary of the Xinhai Uprising)
                . The park was officially named <b>"Hankou Zhongshan Park"</b> in
                honour of Dr Sun Yat-sen. The main gate of the park was 
                designed according to the Buckingham Palace, and the 
                stone piers on both sides of the gate were engraved with 
                characters "Zhongshan" and "Park".</h5>

                and dug up the park's rockery to build a motor depot, 
                and tied military horses to the trees. Trees were nibbled 
                by horses and withered, and some were cut down to build 
                fortifications, turning the park into a military barracks.</h5>
