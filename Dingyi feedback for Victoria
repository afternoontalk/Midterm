Aesthetics: I like how you added your own aesthetic choices in showing your work on the webpage. 
I is informative on one hand and also show your personality and your interest at the same time. 
I believe it will be very intriguing for someone who is interested in going through your portfolio! 
From the class presentation, I feel like there is more space for consistency and motif for design.
Design elements I enjoy is the moving GIF in index page and the y box for the writing page, love to see more of them:) 

Accessibility, Readability and Ease-of-Use: All the images are described in detail alt text, improving reading accessibility.
The website is well-structured and directions are clear on the index page for users to navigate themseles. 
Good job! The page could be designed to be flexible for different screen size to enhance readability.

Technique: The HTML and CSS is readable and clear structed which is very easy to read and follow. 
The overall organization and formatting make sense and seem efficient and logical. 

Ethics: I like how the link of your work is linked to its original source of publish. 
I donâ€™t notice there is any outside code that has been used in this project. 
And the choice of including footer in all the pages successfully protects the codes. 
The only concern I will have is the images on the index page. Will their copyright be 
anything we need to pay attention to? If there are mix of our own image and stock image 
from internet in the webpage, should we include any note on using the stock image?
